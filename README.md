# MIRROR. ðŸ‘¾

MIRROR is a tool for self-exploration and language reflection through interactive dialogue. It helps users observe and understand their patterns of thought, tone, and expression by progressively adapting to their communication style.

> ðŸŒž Inspired by my Meditation Teachers Shinzen Young, Sadhguru, and Bhante Gunaratana. They have been pivotal in my life's journey, inspiring me at every stage to understand myself at all levels. The goal of MIRROR is to to become full-fledged human beings, and share human goodness through the craft of programming.

Built with a hacker-first mindset for the open-source (FOSS) and research communities.

## Overview.

MIRROR engages users in conversation and gradually adjusts its language and tone to reflect the user's style. By controlling the degree of mimicry, users can observe the evolution of the system's responses and gain new perspectives on their own habits of expression. MIRROR can be used as a mindfulness instrument, a research probe for linguistic drift, or a practical companion for thoughtful interaction.

## Features.

- Interactive CLI for open-ended conversation.
- Adjustable mimic power. Decide how much MIRROR mirrors you!
- Persistent conversation history for longitudinal self-observation.
- Quantitative and qualitative feedback to understand system behaviour.
- Baked-in Explainable AI techniques to analyze LLM behaviour.
- Designed to enhance mindfulness skills.
- Integrated psychological analysis to get a peek into your mind.

## Usage.

Start MIRROR from the command line:

```bash
mirror
```

Adjust mimic power at any time:

## Research Applications.

- Analysis of language and tone adaptation in interactive systems.
- Exploration of self-reflective dialogue.
- Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral research through language.
- Push the boundaries on LLM research.

## Philosophy.

MIRROR is inspired by the practice of self-observation and mindful awareness. The project invites users to reflect on how they communicate and how technology can amplify, challenge, or clarify patterns of mind. At the highest level, MIRROR can help you reporgram your mental patterns. The SDK is like having the source code to your mind!
